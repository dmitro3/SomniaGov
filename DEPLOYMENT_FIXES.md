# Vercel Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved âœ…

### 1. Mixed Content Security Error (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Vercel site served over HTTPS was trying to connect to `http://dream-rpc.somnia.network/` (HTTP), causing browser security blocks.

**Solution**: Updated RPC URLs to use HTTPS in `src/config/contracts.ts`:
- Changed `http://dream-rpc.somnia.network/` â†’ `https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/`
- Applied to both mainnet and testnet configurations

### 2. Missing Static Assets
**Problem**: `vite.svg` resource was missing, causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created proper `public/vite.svg` file with Vite logo.

### 3. Build Compatibility (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: Contract imports from `artifacts/` folder causing build failures.

**Solution**: 
- Extracted clean ABI arrays to `src/config/` folder
- Updated import paths to use local config files
- Eliminated artifacts folder dependency

### 4. Code Cleanup
**Problem**: Unused code and folders cluttering the project.

**Solution**: Removed unused `src/contracts/abis/` folder that wasn't referenced anywhere.

## Expected Results After Deployment

âœ… **Mixed Content errors eliminated** - All API calls now use HTTPS  
âœ… **Static assets load properly** - No more 404 for vite.svg  
âœ… **Contract interactions work** - RPC calls should succeed  
âœ… **Clean build process** - No artifacts folder dependencies  

## Notes

- **Keep hardcoded IPFS badge images**: The hardcoded badge mapping in `useProposals.ts` is necessary for badge images to display correctly.
- **Lit dev mode warnings**: These come from Web3Modal dependencies and are harmless in production.
- **Contract addresses**: Ensure your environment variables are properly set in Vercel dashboard.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel with these fixes
2. Test contract interactions on the live site
3. Verify badge images display correctly
4. Confirm all HTTPS RPC calls succeed

The main blocker (Mixed Content HTTPS/HTTP issue) has been resolved! ðŸš€
